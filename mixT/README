This code implements the spectro-T weighting algorithm described in
Vikhlinin 2005. Please consult this PAPER for all details (file mixT.pdf
included here).


*************************************************************************
INSTALLATION:

1) Edit Makefile.solaris or Makefile.linux (or setup an analogues file for
   your $OSTYPE).

2) make

   this creates two programs, mk_cal and weightT

   mk_cal precomputes the calibration tables described in the PAPER
   weightT should be used as an example of how to compute the T_spec
           using the algorithm described in the PAPER

USAGE:

mk_cal  z=0.05  nH=4e20  rmf=chandra.rmf arf=chandra.arf \
  -emin 0.7 -emax 10 >  tcal.dat

   (create calibration for Chandra response and cluster at z=0.05, Galactic
   absorption 4e20 cm**-2; fit in the 0.7-10 keV energy band)


./weightT  cal=tcal.dat  [mode=XMM/PN or XMM/MOS or ASCA/SIS or ASCA/GIS]
  (see Paper re the difference between Chandra and XMM and ASCA).


========= Notes on various codes used here ================================

mekal.F:  interpolates over XSPEC cal file to compute MEKAL model for 
          the given T and metallicity

sigism.f:   obtained from HEASARC
readrmf.f:  collection of FTOOLS routines to read the response matrix
calutil.f:  misc FTOOLS routines required by readrmf
